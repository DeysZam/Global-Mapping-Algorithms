# Global-Mapping-Algorithms

Global Mapping Algorithms are used for automatic traversals for vehicles through an obstacle course. Some examples of algorithms involved in literature review of working of heuristics are D*,D* lite, Dijkstra Algorithms.
This repository has implementation of A* mapping algorithm on MATLAB with test-script.
